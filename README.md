**Check out my [blog](https://jacekmajchrzak.com/blog/) or say hi on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JacekMajchrzak_)!**

**[Data Mesh]** is a new paradigm to data architecture that follows four principles: 
1. Domain-oriented data and compute 
2. Data as a product
3. Self-serve data platform
4. Federated computational governance
